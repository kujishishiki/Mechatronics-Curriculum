# Mechatronics-Curriculum

Yet Another Curriculum

## Preamble

This is a Curriculum that I'm building for myself, it should be noted that the partionning between fields might be inacurrate as I have no formal experience with most of the notions
that it contains. \
I'm grateful to all the people that creates, puts on the Internet and maintains those wonderful courses, books, articles... as well as those repertoring and indexing these precious ressources,
allowing people like myself to access education at marginal cost. For you are the seeders of minds. \
I hope that someday I will be able to participate in this joint effort to share knowledge globally.

May the human civilisation expand and flourish.
